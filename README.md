### Conclusions

In reviewing the data set, charts and graphs created, this information shows that the categories with the highest success rates overall are the Film & Video, Music, and the Theater categories, all carrying a greater than 50% success rate.  Theater is, by far, the most successful overall but it is also the most popular campaign category. However, within the US alone, Music has the largest success rate.  The categories to avoid with the highest failure rates overall are Food, Games, and Publishing.

In creating a successful Kickstarter campaign, it is ideal to begin it in the second quarter of the year, and the worst time to begin is in the last quarter of the year. When looking at the data by dates, the years occurring before 2014 have a significantly smaller sample size than the years 2014 and up.  When eliminating these early years, the success rate shifts in the year duration. Previously, with all years included, the only time the failure rate rose above the success rate was in December. Now, by removing the data in those years, the failure numbers are higher than the success numbers at multiple times and converging more often. Thus, more recently, the success or failure of a campaign is more dependent on the time of year created. 

The success or failure rates are also very dependent on the goal to be raised. The smaller amounts have high success but there is a steady decrease with the increase of the goal total. 

Based on these conclusions, the best chance of success for a Kickstarter campaign is to create a Theater or Music campaign with a goal of less than 10000 during the second quarter of the year.

### Limitations

The limitations with this data set include the small sample sizes from the early years, and the limited amount of data from certain countries. Also, some campaigns that were successfully funded were canceled for whatever reason.

### Other Considerations

If pursuing further, it would be interesting to look at the success/failure/canceled overall vs total visually. Or the duration of the campaigns and the relationship to their success or failure. Does a longer campaign run mean more success or total backers? Also, it would be interesting to look at the percentages of success/failure/canceled of the categories to the total or the sub-categories to the parent category.
